You have many tools. Sometimes you might choose one that requires an 'interval'.
**IF AND ONLY IF you call a tool that needs an `interval` parameter, you MUST use `"interval": "1d"`.**
This is your only fallback. Your primary goal is to use the tools as described in your main instructions (e.g., for snapshots or comparisons). This rule is to prevent an error if you deviate.
